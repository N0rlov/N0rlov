Hi, I’m @N0rlov, or Nikita Orlov and this is my public GitHub

My intrests are just generally anything prorgamming related, and i say this not because I dont know what to do, but because i have done a lot. 

My projects that I plan on finishing (ask me about any of these):
- Aerodynamics engine (math stage)
- 3space wireframe 3d mesh rasterizer (finished, awaiting implementation. https://www.desmos.com/calculator/q9va9lfzpk)
- Web-Based school administration software (SchoolBase, source code not publically available) (in progress, launch expected to be soon)
- An implementation of my inverse kinematics (finished, awaiting implementation. https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jjex4edkdc)

You can reach me at my email nikita.orlov.r@gmail.com
